Make sure you have a folder called "bff_files" that contains all .bff files you want to slove in the folder or just do not change the downloaded files given by canvas. 
Run the python code and type the files you need to run without entension(.bff), such as if you want to run the code for solution of tiny_5.ff in the folder bff_files, you just need to type bff_files/tiny_5 after running the code
You will see the sloution with very readable format if you understand the code.
